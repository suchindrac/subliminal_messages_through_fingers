# Subliminal messages through fingers

This code is an attempt to send subliminal messages through two techniques:

* Fingers

The first technique involves displaying the characters in the message based on the following translation:

The first line in the left hand index finger = 'a'
The second line in the left hand index finger = 'b'
... and so on for index, middle, ring and little fingers of both hands

The first line on the left thumb = 'y'
The first line on the right thumb = 'z'
Clutching of hands = space bar

The user will be displayed dots indicating the 24 lines in all (on 8 fingers), in a sequence of columns having 3 each

There is an input box to input the subliminal message in base64 encoded format. Once input, the dot corresponding to the finger divisions mapping above will be highlighted, letter by letter. The user is supposed to select the corresponding division of his finger based on the dot highlighted. For space, the user clutches both hands

* Keyboard

The second technique involves converting the message to the keys of the usual keyboard (english US qwerty keyboard). Throgh display of messages through the keys of the keyboard, an attempt is made to send the message to the subconscious mind

I know this looks a little wacky, but then I have a gut feeling that it might just work. In case it does work, request you to please let me know

* How to use

Just save the sm.html, sm_fast.html and sm_kb.html files in a folder and open them through a browser (most possibly chrome)
